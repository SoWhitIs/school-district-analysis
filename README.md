# _What **do** the scores say?_ || PyCity School District Analysis 

## Overview of Project

On task with assisting the Chief Data Scientist of the PyCity School District. Analysis consisted of review "clean-up" of standardized test score data from local high schools, by which findings would later give insights as to strategic planning of future budgets 
and priorities by the school board and superintendent.

Upon completion of initial analysis, it was brought to attention that file: students_complete.csv, a source for said analysis, containing Math and Reading testing results from Thomas High School ninth graders, respectively, had been altered.

 While, the extent of the alteration is unknown, to uphold the state-testing standards the _ "remedy"_ was to re-do the analysis excluding the former Thomas High School ninth grade test results data (subsequently using the _only_ data from tenth to twelfth grade). 

### Resources
•	Data Source (s): students_complete.csv, schools_complete.csv

•	Software: Python 3.7.6 64-bit, Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda *

•	Data Access: Workaround, [Project Jupyter: jupyter nbviewer](nbviewer.jupyter.org), a Jupytner Notebook renderer **

    * Some DataFrames on _PyCitySchools_Challenge file may not present intact. Specifically, data is not aligned or showcased under its appropriate column in GitHub appearing “jumbled up”. *

### Results
#### What has been impacted? 

Aforementioned, the basis of re-analysis was due to inaccuracies in reported ninth grade Math and Reading standardized scores from Thomas High School.  The analysis consisted of the same general calculations, methodology, and overall objectives with additions or edits in code to address the data set change. By replacing this data with NaN attributes, all “usable” data was kept intact given way to the following results:

		    Data Background
    * Initial Analysis Dataset: 39,170 students, 15 Schools (Varied Types: Districts, Charter)
    *  New Analysis Dataset: 38, 709 Students, 15 Schools (Varied Types: Districts, Charter)
	    Percentage Change (Difference in Size) of 1.17692111% or 1.2%
